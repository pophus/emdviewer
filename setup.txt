Building From Source
--------------------

Requirements:

CMake - Tested with versions 3.2 and 3.8, but any version >= 3.2 should work.

HDF5 - Tested with version 1.8.12. Build errors have been seen with some newer 
versions, so stick with 1.8.12 if you don't want to fix anything. Make sure to 
get the 64-bit version.

Qt - Tested with version 5.2.0. Newer versions should work, but try at your own 
risk. Make sure to get the 64-bit OpenGL version.

[Windows Only] Visual Studio 2012 - Problems have been seen with newer versions
(e.g. VS2015), so it might not work out of the box. If you want to use a newer
version then please fix the problems and update this guide.

[OSX Only] Xcode - The latest version should work.

Windows:

1. Create a build folder somewhere, e.g. in the root level of your emdViewer
repository.

2. Open the Visual Studio command prompt, called something like "Developer Command
Prompt for VS2012", and navigate to your build folder. For example:

    cd C:\Code\emdViewer\build

3. Set environment variables for your HDF5 and Qt install locations. This helps
cmake find the required files. For example:

    set HDF5_ROOT_DIR_HINT=C:\Program Files\HDF5\1.8.12\
    set QT_DIR=C:\Qt\5.2.0-64\5.2.0\msvc2012_64_opengl\

The specified folders should be the ones containing "bin", "include", etc.

4. Run the cmake command with your emdviewer repository root as the target location.
For example, if you put your build folder in the repo root:

    cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 11 2012 Win64"

Note: make sure to run cmake from inside your build folder!

This command will generate the Visual Studio project files to build the project.
If you get an error that cmake can't be found, make sure your CMake install directory
is in your Path variable (check with "set Path"). If it's not there you can either
add it or just specify the full path to cmake.exe, e.g.:

    C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 11 2012 Win64"

5. Open the generated solution file in Visual Studio (emdviewer.sln).

6. Right-click the emdViewer project in the solution explorer and select "Set as
StartUp Project".

7. Use the run button to build and run the app. The selector at the top is used to
switch between debug and release builds.

To create the installer, build the INSTALL and PACKAGE targets.


OSX:

OSX has not been tested with the latest code, but the required steps are very similar
to Windows. Make a build folder, set directories, run cmake (using the Xcode generator),
and build the generated project file in Xcode. If you get it to work please update the
build instructions and contribute any required fixes.
